The goal in this project was crawling the 279 urls and extracing just the text from every url and adding the text into anthor csv file already exist just to update it 
the challenge was finding the perfect selector for every website and extract it clean and without tags

Some of the websites using scraper detecting techniques so i had to get around this techniques and extracting the informations
I also used async to send multiple requsest in order to get fast response and i was able to reduce the time to half 

# Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that does not block.

# Instead, requests and function calls are issued and executed somehow in the background at some future time. This frees the caller to perform other activities and handle the results of issued calls at a later time when results are available or when the caller is interested.
